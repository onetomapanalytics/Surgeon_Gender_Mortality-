This file contains cleaning, preparation and merging code for the Physician Compare 2016 with the Florida AHCA yearly files (2010-2015), and contains brief code for appending(stacking) the merged files from step 2 to create a combined yearly master file. 

*Reading the AHCA 2010 Data file

drop if Years_Exp <0

save "FL AHCA PUF & Physician Compare 2010",replace
