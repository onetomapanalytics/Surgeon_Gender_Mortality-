# Surgeon_Gender_Mortality-
A prediction model for in hospital mortality by physician gender
This analysis was performed by linking Florida Agency for HealthCare Administration (FL AHCA) dataset with CMS Physician Compare Public Use file (Phy Compare) for the Year 2016. FL AHCA was primarily used to capture the procedures of interest and analyze patient factors, whereas Phy Compare enabled us to analyze the surgeon gender, specialty, and years of experience.  
Acccess to FL AHCA is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization by the Florida Agency of Health Care Administration, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes.    
Physican Compare data is publicly available for download through CMS website. 
We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies.
All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Data preprocessing was done using STATA, and modelling was performed in R.
